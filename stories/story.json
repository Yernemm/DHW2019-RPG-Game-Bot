Your client didn't specify your destination very well either. 'A large red-bricked cottage, just at the end of this road', she told you. Yet eventually, the road splits. You stare down both roads. The road to your right enters a deep, dark forest. The road to your left leads you down by a gentle stream. Not knowing which one will lead you to the recipient, you head down the left route as it is clearly safer and much more pleasant.",

The only **true** adventure must be down the harsh, unforgiving path, most certainly filled with traps, monsters, and monster traps. You take a step back, turn to face the danger head-on, and run with all your might. You hear the overly-dramatic adventuring music kicking in as you sprint through your adventurous montage sequence.

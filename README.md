# "The Discord Parable" for Discord Hack Week 2019

## Ok, what does the bot do?
This bot provides a non-linear story with many branching paths and multiple endings. There are some hidden paths which only show up 10% of the time to encourage re-playability. The story is stored in JSON and editable.

## What is the story about?
It is a comedy, fantasy-themed story. You are a courier tasked with delivering a package for your client. The client, however, does not give you very good directions. You reach a set of two diverging paths and it's up to you to choose which path to follow...

## Tell me, who is responsible for this mess?
